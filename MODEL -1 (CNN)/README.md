`1. Short Time Fourier Transform`

The Fourier transform of an audio signal tells which frequencies are present in the signal along with the intensity of that frequency. 
If it is applied over the full audio signal, it loses the information of time dependence of these frequencies (that is when they occur). 
More precisely, Fourier Transform of a signal gives all the frequencies appearing in the signal averaged out over the duration (on which the transform is applied).

Hence, the Fourier transform is applied on different segments of signal one by one, and then all the outputs are then stitched together providing a more rigorous analysis.

There is a possible chance of generating unwanted frequency values due to the signal present at the ends of each 'window' considered. 
Hence the signal is smoothened out at the ends (the magnitude is lowered by applying a weight) for reducing any error.
Consequently, a window generally overlaps its previous window so that the information present in the signal at the ends of a window is counted again and preserved at its best.

The number of samples in each window taken is 512.

The hop size of each window is 256.

The number of samples in each window taken is in the power of 2. It greatly reduces the time complexity in the Fast Fourier transform algorithm.


`2. Constant Q Transforms`

CQT transform varies frequencies on a logarithmic scale whereas STFT varies it linearly.
Also, CQT shows more accuracy for lower frequencies bins and comparatively lesser for higher frequencies bins as the signal is effectively covered in the lower range.

As frequency is varied exponentially on the axis, the distance between the harmonics is nearly constant
whereas in the STFT the distance between harmonics varies exponentially.

CQT has an edge over STFT when several octaves are present substantially in the audio signal.


`3. Mel Spectograms`

Mel Spectograms are a plot against the Mel scale vs time (rather than the frequency vs time).
One differentiates between frequencies in terms of how he perceives its pitch.
As frequency and pitch vary exponentially, the same difference between any 2 frequencies will not correspond to same perceptual difference in their pitch at all values.

In the Mel scale, the same difference between any 2 Mels correspond to perceptually similar difference in the pitch. 
Therefore signal is analyzed in another scale, Mel scale.
This is done by applying a Mel filter to the output of our original STFT.

The number of samples in each window taken is 2048.

The hop size of each window is 512.

Number of Mel bands taken = 252.
